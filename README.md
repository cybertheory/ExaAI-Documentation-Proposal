# Documentation Example Ideas for Exa

I chose to implement [idea two](#idea-2-a-tutorial-for-building-a-prompt-enhancer-for-image-generation) as a tutorial.

> I have contributed to Exa before! On May 23rd of 2024 I had suggested to Jefferey to include an [index](https://docs.exa.ai/reference/the-exa-index) for Exa - it would improve transparency - he liked the idea. According to Wayback Machine, the first time the page was indexed on May 25th of 2024.ðŸ˜Š

## Idea 1: A Tutorial on People Search for Co-Founder Matching or Networking

### Description
An example of using Exa's semantic retrieval capabilities to find contacts that match the user's criteria for a co-founder.

It would work by using Exa's data on personal LinkedIn profiles to find contacts that match the user's criteria for a co-founder. According to the [Exa Index](https://docs.exa.ai/reference/the-exa-index), this data is still being indexed and will be available soon.

### Reasoning
I have considered using Exa before for [veb.ai](https://veb.ai). VebAI was a social network and personal networking assistant that I ideated, it relied on emebedings to help people search and maintain a professional netwokr. We were looking for niche sources of information that we could use to build our product. Exa's semantic retrieval capabilities would have allowed us to find contacts that match the user's criteria for a co-founder, and save a lot of time and money scraping LinkedIn.

The developer market also has a lot of overlap with people looking for co-founders, and this would be a great way to provide value and increase adoption of Exa.

## Idea 2: A Tutorial for Building a Prompt Enhancer for Image Generation

Here is the [documentation](doc.md) for the tutorial.

### Description
Am example for prompt enhancer for image generation, is a novel use of Exa's semantic retrieval capabilities. By using Exa's semantic retrieval capabilities, we can create a prompt enhancer for image generation. This would allow users to create prompts for image generation that are more accurate and relevant to their needs.

It works by using Exa's semantic retrieval capabilities to find the most relevant details and characteristics of the desired subject. It then uses these details to create a prompt that is more accurate and relevant to the user's needs.

## Reasoning
Image Generation is a very popular use case for AI, and there are many different ways to use it. I thought it would be cool to have a tutorial for building a prompt enhancer for image generation. This would help developers understand how to use Exa's semantic retrieval capabilities to create a prompt enhancer for image generation.

This would also help increase the adoption of Exa, as it opens new use cases for Exa, in this casee, image generation. By having a tutorial for building a prompt enhancer for image generation, we can help developers understand how to use Exa's semantic retrieval capabilities to create better images and this can maybe even lead to a new revenue stream and business strategy for Exa.

I also see Exa's python library has a Chat Completions Wrapper for OpenAI, which is a great way to use Exa's semantic retrieval capabilities to enhance the quality of the output of the Chat Completions API through RAG. Having a similar feature for the image generation API would be a great way to increase the adoption of Exa, as it would allow developers to use Exa's semantic retrieval capabilities to create better images within the python library.
